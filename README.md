# SPORTY-SHOES-DATA-MINING-DEMO
This project is a demonstration of my expertise in data modelling, data cleaning, ETL, data mining, and statistical analysis.  The aim is to boost business profitability through the provision of key insights about business operations. Tools used include Excel, Power Query, and Power BI.

This project was conceived and created from scratch by myself. 
Using Excel, I collected and validated the data immitating a real-world scenario. 
Firstly, I designed and modelled the database to immitate a retail shop that sells footwears, called SPORTY SHOES. 
Then, I cleaned, transformed, and integrated the dataset from multiple source files into a unified view which was loaded to excel files. 
These excel files were used as data warehouses only requiring periodic refreshes to access up-to-date information. 
From these data warehouses, I performed data mining and analysis to provide important information about key aspects of the business in the form of dashboards.

The output of my analysis is contained in the PDF. Kindly download the PDF to view key information.
